# MLWithPython
This repository contains google colab python notebooks inspired from the nice course that I took on Coursera: Applied Machine Learning in Python https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning. 

I have made mindmaps for each of the concepts, which serve as great ways for me to remember where the concept fits in the greater knowledge base, and a great way to look up a specific topic at any time.

Each notebook contains mindmap for the concept followed by a few case studies using the concept. 

Hope this is useful to others!
